	sending takes a little longer as sending with a pdf file seems to be a bit slower than just regular HTML. But still faster than doing it manually!


**HOW TO MINIMIZE ERROR ON WELCOME EMAIL SPREADSHEET**
1. Copy the template I have, on column B "Types". Go to Data Validation. 
	Settings, Allow "list". check both "Ignore blank" and "In-cell dropdown"
	on Source paste: GPS SmartSole,Take-Along,Invisabelt
	Click OK	
	*This limits data input error on the Type, where spelling error and capitalization could occurs. And python might not be able to read those inputs.
